## Overview

The following problems are intended to serve as a test to your programming skills.You are required to write a program to solve each of the following tasks.

Your submission may be judged according to the following preliminary criteria:

- Correctness
- Readability

Your submission may futher be judged as follows:

- Logic-flow
- Runtime
- Memory management

## Problem Set

Here starts the problem set. Please be in mind that your program will be judged against multiple test cases. Your program must pass all test cases in order to be judged correct.

### Primes!

Most people can recite all prime numbers from 2 to 97, but few can do the same for prime numbers onward. Alice is trying to list out all prime numbers in range of 2 and a positive integer N. Can you help her?

#### Input

There shall be only one number for the input, the integer N.

#### Output

A list of prime numbers in range of 2 and N, inclusive, each number in its own line.

#### Constraints

2 < N < 1000

#### Sample Input

```
10

```

#### Sample Output

```
2
3
5
7

```

### Fractions!

Bob is a primary school student. He has difficulties adding fractions together, not to say expressing the final result in the simplest form. Luckily you have agreed to write a program for him.

#### Input

The input consists of 2 lines, each with 2 integers A and B, where A is the numerator of the fraction and B is the denominator.

#### Output

The output consists of 1 line having 2 integers M and N, where M/N is a fraction in simplest form, which is the addition of the 2 input fractions.

#### Constraints

1 < A < 1000, 1 < B < 1000

#### Sample Input

```
2 3
3 4

```

### Sample Output

```
17 12

```
